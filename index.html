        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1856</strong> - Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day
            Croatia)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
            the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
            Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
            US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
            Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
            he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
            Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
            his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
            disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
            Pathology
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
            leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
            plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
            6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
            different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
            season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
            with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
            well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
            strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
            mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1909</strong> - The 1909 Nobel Prize for physics is shared
            between Guglielmo Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition
            of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy."
            Tesla is furious and intensifies his long battle to correct the
            injustice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
            increase their maize and sorghum yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
            A&M University
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
            food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
            only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - dies at the age of 86 in New York City,
            United States.
          </li>
